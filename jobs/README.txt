- I correctly parsed the string using the function JSON.parse(txt).
- I then created 9 different lists, 1 for each of the jobs.
- I was able to access the name of each company using obj[i].company

- I think if I spent more time on this that I could have written less code and used some
kind of for loop because it seemed like most of my code was repetitive.

- All jobs are listed with the required information in an easy to read list format.
