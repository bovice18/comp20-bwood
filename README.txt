LAB 11:

1. This private repo was for submitting assignments for Web Programming class at Tufts University in the Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013.

2. Assignment 3 was my favorite assignment because it was the first time that I have really ever made anything that could possibly be useful in my everyday life.  A tool for finding the schedule of the T at each redline stop would be very useful to thousands of people who use the redline every day to commute.

3. I am probably most proud of either assignment 3 or 4.  I am proud of assignment 3 because it was the first project that I was able put on a server and let other people access and try it out (using my bovice.github.com page).  Being able to send it home and show my parents something that I made was a good feeling.  I am proud of assignment 4 because of the amount of time that went into creating it.  Once again it was a good feeling to put it on my bovice.github.com page and let others give it a try.

4. I have grown a lot by taking this course.  I did not know exactly what to expect coming into the class but I have learned a ton.  This class was very important to me because it introduced me to something that I may want to do in the future after I graduate.

**Thanks for a great semester
